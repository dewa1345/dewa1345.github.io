# What is Limit
 a limit is a concept used to determine the value that a function or sequence approaches as its variable gets closer to a specific point. Based on my understanding, a limit is a method of approximating a number through systematic calculations. In many cases, limits help us understand how a function behaves as its independent variable approaches a certain value, whether from the left or the right. In other words, limits allow us to determine an approximate result, even when the exact value of the function may be difficult or impossible to calculate directly.

 Under here is where i tried recreate what my lecturer about do about how limit works

As we can see from what i tried it calculate the approximate number but cant calculate the exact number
